🌐 What is Kickstarter?

Kickstarter is a popular crowdfunding platform where creators can raise funds for their projects directly from the public. Backers (supporters) pledge money to bring creative ideas to life across various domains like technology, games, design, film, music, and more. Projects are typically funded only if they reach their goal amount within a specific time frame.
